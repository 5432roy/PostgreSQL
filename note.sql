-- "LIKE" command, '_' is a wildcard character, which can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern
-- "LIKE" is not case sensitive
SELECT * FROM note
-- such as "R3y", "Rdy", "Roy" is fitting the condition
WHERE name LIKE 'R_y';

-- '%' is also a wildcard character, which can replace an enitre missing string or character

-- this is a case sensetive statement

-- OR is the same

-- AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)

-- GROUP BY, this command will put the same category together inorder
SELECT id, name, calendar
FROM note

-- can have more than one GROUP like
SELECT id, name, calendar
FROM note
-- 1 is the first column for SELECT, in here id, 2 is name...
GROUP BY 1, 2

-- HAVING is pretty similar with WHERE but HAVING are more often used with GROUP BY, and before ORDER BY and LIMIT

-- Creating another table to do multiple tables operations
CREATE TABLE temp(

-- Dealing with multiple tables "Join table_name ON matching_property1 = matching_property2"
-- For "JOIN" if there is anything that two properties cannot match, the output will ignore that row automatically, which is so called "inner join"
-- To get the property(column) from table, use "table_name.column_name"
SELECT * 
FROM note
JOIN temp
ON note.id = temp.id;

-- For "LEFT JOIN" the mismatching will still be operated but the property from second table will be set to null
SELECT *
FROM note
JOIN temp
ON note.id = temp.id
-- this will only show the things in note but not in temp;
WHERE temp.id IS NULL;

-- "CROSS JOIN" the output of the query will be the all combination from all selected columns both tables;
SELECT id
FROM note
CROSS JOIN temp;

-- "UNION" this will simpliy put two table together without doing other fancy things
-- restriction: two tables have to have same number of selected columns and same types of date
